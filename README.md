<h1 align="center">BoatsJumper</h1>


**BoatsJumper** does exactly what the name says: makes boats jump! 

## Limitations
Here are known limitations of the plugin:
 - BoatsJumper only works with boats, not boats with chests.
 - In order to teleport the boat upwards, the plugin needs to eject the player from the boat. 
   - Because of the teleport issue, some jumps may not work as expected, especially if the player is not in the boat when the jump is triggered.
   - Known not working: water, stairs (kinda work, when the boat doesn't teleport you need to back up a bit)
   - Only the boat driver will see correct positions, other players will see the boat jumping in blocks until relogging in.
   - Works? Works (kinda), don't touch it :)
